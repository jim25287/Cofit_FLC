      <description>The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend two-and-a-half cup equivalents of low-fat and fat-free dairy foods per day for children four to eight years and three cup equivalents per day for adolescents ages nine to eighteen and adults. Currently, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recognizes four nutrients as being of public concern due to suboptimal levels in the diet. These include calcium, dietary fiber, potassium, and vitamin D. In the American diet ─ dairy foods are leading contributors of calcium, vitamin D, and potassium.</description>

      <description>Resistant starch (RS) has become a popular topic of research in recent years. Most scholars believe that there are five types of RS. However, accumulating evidence indicates that in addition to starch–lipid complexes, which are the fifth type of RS, complexes containing starch and other substances can also be generated. The physicochemical properties and physiological functions of these complexes are worth exploring. New physiological functions of several original RSs are constantly being discovered.</description>

      <description>Cellular senescence has long been considered a permanent state of cell cycle arrest occurring in proliferating cells subject to different stressors, used as a cellular defense mechanism from acquiring potentially harmful genetic faults. However, recent studies highlight as senescent cells might also alter the local tissue environment and concur to chronic inflammation and cancer risk by secreting inflammatory and matrix remodeling factors, acquiring a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP).</description>

      <description>Achieving optimal health is an aspirational goal for the population, yet the definition of health remains unclear. The role of nutrition in health has evolved beyond correcting malnutrition and specific deficiencies, and has begun to focus more on achieving and maintaining ‘optimal’ health through nutrition. As such, the Council for Responsible Nutrition held its October 2022 Science in Session conference to advance this concept. Here, we summarize and discuss the findings of their Optimizing Health through Nutrition – Opportunities and Challenges workshop, including several gaps that need to be addressed to advance progress in the field.</description>

      <link>https://advances.nutrition.org/article/S2161-8313(23)00318-6/fulltext?rss=yes</link>
      <description>Cancer is one of the primary causes of death worldwide and its incidence continues to increase year by year. Despite significant advances in research, the search for effective and non-toxic preventive and therapeutic agents remains greatly important. Cancer is a multimodal disease, where various mechanisms play significant roles in its occurrence and progression. This highlights the need for multi-targeted approaches that are not only safe and inexpensive, but provide effective alternatives for current therapeutic regimens.</description>

      <description>The high cost of healthy foods makes maintaining a healthy dietary pattern challenging, particularly amongst people with diabetes who are experiencing food insecurity. The objectives of this study were to: 1) review evidence on the impact of providing material benefits (e.g., food coupons/vouchers, free food, or financial subsidies/incentives) to improve access to food on clinical parameters, dietary intake, and household food insecurity in people with diabetes, and 2) review relevant economic evidence.</description>

      <description>Within the organism, the liver is the main organ responsible for metabolic homeostasis and xenobiotic transformation. In order to maintain an adequate liver weight-to-bodyweight ratio, this organ has an extraordinary regenerative capacity, able to respond to an acute insult or partial hepatectomy (PH). Maintenance of hepatic homeostasis is crucial for the proper functioning of the liver, and in this context, an adequate nutrition with macro- and micronutrient intake is mandatory. Among all known macro-minerals, magnesium has a key role in energy metabolism and in metabolic and signaling pathways that maintain liver function and physiology throughout its life span.</description>

      <description>The effects of supplementation with whey protein alone or with vitamin D on sarcopenia-related outcomes in older adults are unclear. We aimed to assess the effect of whey protein supplementation alone or with vitamin D on lean mass (LM), strength, and function in older adults with or without sarcopenia or frailty. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) that investigated the effect of whey protein supplementation with or without vitamin D on sarcopenia outcomes in healthy and sarcopenic or frail older adults were included.</description>

      <description>The consumption of artificially sweetened beverages (ASBs) is increasing in some countries. However, some meta-analyses have found that habitual consumers of ASBs (compared with low or no consumption) had an increased risk on some health outcomes. We performed an umbrella review of meta-analyses to grade the credibility of the evidence of claimed observational associations between ASBs and health outcomes. Data were searched in Web of Science, Embase, and PubMed for systematic reviews published up to 25 May 2022, examining association between ASBs and any health outcomes.</description>

      <description>Serine has been recently identified as an essential metabolite for oncogenesis, progression, and adaptive immunity. Influenced by many physiological or tumor environmental factors, the metabolic pathways of serine synthesis, uptake, and usage are heterogeneously reprogrammed and frequently amplified in tumor or tumor-associated cells. The hyperactivation of serine metabolism promotes abnormal cellular nucleotide/protein/lipid synthesis, mitochondrial function, and epigenetic modifications, which drive malignant transformation, unlimited proliferation, metastasis, immunosuppression, and drug resistance of tumor cells.</description>

      <description>Low-income and food-insecure households are at risk of poor dietary quality and even more severe food insecurity. Especially in childhood, consuming a nutritionally adequate diet is an essential driver of health, growth, and development. Household-level factors can present challenges to support the nutritional needs of low-income and food-insecure household members. The aim of this scoping review is to identify the contributing household factors to dietary quality and food security in US households of school-aged children 5 to 19 years and synthesize the evidence around emergent themes for application to future interventions.</description>

      <description>Food-based dietary guidelines (FBDG) need to be evidence-based. As part of the development of Ethiopian FBDG, we conducted an umbrella review to develop dietary recommendations. Protein-energy malnutrition, deficiencies of vitamin A, zinc, calcium, or folate, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were selected as priority. Systematic reviews were eligible if they investigated the impact of foods, food groups, diet, or dietary patterns on priority diseases. After a search, 1513 articles were identified in PubMed, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar published from January 2014 to December 2021.</description>

      <description>Most Americans have dietary sodium intakes that exceed the recommended limits, which is a risk factor for hypertension and CVD. The share of total food expenditures for foods prepared and consumed away from home (FAFH) is ∼55%. These foods are consumed at various venues, including restaurants, workplaces, schools and universities, military installations, and assisted living/long-term care facilities. The food service industry has dealt with and continues to deal with various challenges in its attempt to reduce the sodium content in the foods that they prepare and sell.</description>

      <description>In cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention, whether antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications are used as complements to heart-healthy diets has not been thoroughly assessed. This scoping review aimed to 1) analyze observational studies that assessed the relationship between diet and antihypertensive/lipid-lowering medication use and 2) evaluate whether medication was used as a complement to heart-healthy dietary intakes. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL through 14 January, 2023, for studies that assessed either 1) intraindividual changes in diet associated with lipid-lowering/antihypertensive medication initiation or use or 2) interindividual differences in diet between users and nonusers of these medications.</description>

To better understand the relationship between whole-grain intake, cognition, mood, and anxiety, a systematic review was conducted to synthesize available evidence linking whole grains to these outcomes. Four electronic databases were searched from inception to August 2021 for potentially relevant observational and interventional studies.</description>

      <link>https://advances.nutrition.org/article/S2161-8313(23)00291-0/fulltext?rss=yes</link>
      <description>Epidemiologic evidence supports a positive association between ultraprocessed food (UPF) consumption and body mass index. This has led to recommendations to avoid UPFs despite very limited evidence establishing causality. Many mechanisms have been proposed, and this review critically aimed to evaluate selected possibilities for specificity, clarity, and consistency related to food choice (i.e., low cost, shelf-life, food packaging, hyperpalatability, and stimulation of hunger/suppression of fullness); food composition (i.e., macronutrients, food texture, added sugar, fat and salt, energy density, low-calorie sweeteners, and additives); and digestive processes (i.e., oral processing/eating rate, gastric emptying time, gastrointestinal transit time, and microbiome).</description>

      <description>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive impairment and neuroinflammation. Recent research has revealed the crucial role of gut microbiota and microbial metabolites in modulating AD. However, the mechanisms by which the microbiome and microbial metabolites affect brain function remain poorly understood. Here, we review the literature on changes in the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome in patients with AD and in animal models of AD.</description>

      <description>Individual amino acids are widely popular as supplements because of various perceived and real health benefits. However, currently, there are no recommendations set by national health agencies for tolerable upper intake levels (UL) for amino acids because of a lack of well-conducted human dose-response trials. In the past decade, under the initiative of the International Council on Amino Acid Science, a nonprofit organization, a series of UL human clinical studies were conducted. The goal of this narrative review is to summarize the studies on 6 essential amino acids (leucine, tryptophan, methionine, lysine, histidine, and phenylalanine), 2 nonessential amino acids (arginine and serine), and 2 nonproteinogenic amino acids (ornithine and citrulline) and provide the first set of ULs.</description>

      <description>Hypertension is a primary modifiable risk factor for CVD, whereby even small reductions in blood pressure (BP) can decrease risk for CVD events. Modification of dietary patterns is an established, nonpharmacologic approach for the prevention and management of hypertension. Legumes are a prevailing component of dietary patterns associated with lower BP in observational research, but there is a need to understand the effects of legume consumption on BP. This study aimed to synthesize evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the effects of non-oil seed legume consumption on systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (PROSPERO registration: CRD42021237732).</description>

      <description>The gut microbiome has a profound influence on host physiology, including energy metabolism, which is the process by which energy from nutrients is transformed into other forms of energy to be used by the body. However, mechanistic evidence for how the microbiome influences energy metabolism is derived from animal models. In this narrative review, we included human studies investigating the relationship between gut microbiome and energy metabolism —i.e., energy expenditure in humans and energy harvest by the gut microbiome.</description>

      <description>Various health-related effects of long-chain (LC) ω-3 PUFAs, EPA, and DHA have been suggested. LC ω-3 PUFAs reduce TG concentrations and have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antiplatelet, and vascular protective effects. Controversially, they might help in restoring glucose homeostasis via the gut microbiota. However, previous studies have not shown the clear benefits of LC ω-3 PUFAs for CVDs. REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH—representative randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined whether LC ω-3 PUFAs would prevent major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events (MACE)—showed conflicting results with differences in the types, doses, or comparators of LC ω-3 PUFAs and study populations.</description>

      <description>Food has the power to heal. Our bodies transform and are transformed by the elements in food, and the adage that we are what we eat is true. The twentieth century nutrition science focused on decoding the processes and building blocks of this transformation—proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Twenty-first-century nutrition science is aimed at better understanding the increasingly appreciated bioactive substances within the food matrix that help regulate this transformation—fibers, phytonutrients, bioactive fats, and ferments.</description>

      <description>Alcohol consumption remains inconsistently correlated with fracture risk, and a dose–response meta-analysis for specific outcomes is lacking. The objective of this study was to quantitatively integrate the data on the relationship between alcohol consumption and fracture risk. Pertinent articles were identified in PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases up to 20 February 2022. Combined RRs and 95% CIs were estimated by random- or fixed-effects models.

      <description>Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide recommendations to clinicians based on current medical knowledge to guide and reduce variability in clinical care. With advances in nutrition science research, CPGs increasingly include dietary guidance; however, the degree of consistency in dietary recommendations across CPGs has not been investigated. Using a systematic review approach adapted for meta-epidemiologic research, this study compared dietary guidance from current guidelines developed by governments, major medical professional societies, and large health stakeholder associations owing to their often well-defined and standardized processes for guideline development.</description>

      <description>Nuts are an energy-dense food, yet regular consumption is not associated with weight gain. A proportion of the fats found within nuts remains encapsulated within cell walls and cannot be digested. Metabolizable energy (ME) can be explored by measuring fecal fat excretion in human studies and fat release among in vitro studies. This systematic review with narrative synthesis aimed to examine the ME of tree nuts and peanuts (PROSPERO CRD42021252287). PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane, and Embase databases were searched to June 2021.</description>

      <description>Poor nutrition is linked to morbidity and mortality globally. The nutrition transition toward diets composed of high amounts of ultraprocessed foods that are more refined, calorie-dense, and poor in nutrients is considered a factor in the rise of diet-related metabolic diseases in low- and middle-income countries. Historically, nutrition strategies aimed at mitigating metabolic diseases linked to suboptimal diets have targeted isolated nutrients such as fats; however, they overlook the complexity and importance of whole foods and food matrices, which can lead to unintended consequences such as avoidance of nutrient-dense foods.</description>

      <description>The health effects of dairy products are still a matter of scientific debate owing to inconsistent findings across trials. Therefore, this systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) aimed to compare the effects of different dairy products on markers of cardiometabolic health. A systematic search was conducted in 3 electronic databases [MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science; search date: 23 September 2022]. This study included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a ≥12-wk intervention comparing any 2 of the eligible interventions [e.g., high dairy (≥3 servings/d or equal amount in grams per day), full-fat dairy, low-fat dairy, naturally fermented milk products, and low dairy/control (0–2 servings/d or usual diet)].</description>

      <description>The health and environmental advantages of plant-predominant diets will likely lead to increasing numbers of consumers reducing their reliance on animal products. Consequently, health organizations and professionals will need to provide guidance on how best to make this change. In many developed countries, nearly twice as much protein is derived from animal versus plant sources. Potential benefits could result from consuming a higher share of plant protein. Advice to consume equal amounts from each source is more likely to be embraced than advice to eschew all or most animal products.</description>

      <description>Kidney stone disease (KSD) (alternatively nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis) is a global health care problem that affects people in almost all of developed and developing countries. Its prevalence has been continuously increasing with a high recurrence rate after stone removal. Although effective therapeutic modalities are available, preventive strategies for both new and recurrent stones are required to reduce physical and financial burdens of KSD. To prevent kidney stone formation, its etiology and risk factors should be first considered.</description>

      <description>Because of the production of nutrient-deficient infant formulas (IFs), the United States Congress passed regulations on the composition and production of IF, referred to as the Infant Formula Act (IFA), in 1980, which was amended in 1986. More detailed FDA rules have been created since then, specifying the ranges or minimum intakes of nutrients and providing details for the safe production and evaluation of infant formulas. Although generally effective in ensuring safe IF, recent events have made it clear that a re-evaluation of aspects of all the nutrient composition regulations for IF is needed, including consideration of adding requirements related to bioactive nutrients not mentioned in the IFA.</description>

      <description>Nutrient databases are a critical component of nutrition science and the basis of exciting new research in precision nutrition (PN). To identify the most critical components needed for improvement of nutrient databases, food composition data were analyzed for quality, with completeness being the most important measure, and for FAIRness, how well the data conformed with the data science criteria of findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Databases were judged complete if they provided data for all 15 nutrition fact panel (NFP) nutrient measures and all 40 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) essential nutrient measures for each food listed.</description>

      <link>https://advances.nutrition.org/article/S2161-8313(23)00217-X/fulltext?rss=yes</link>
      <description>The idea that increasing physical activity directly adds to TEE in humans (additive model) has been challenged by the energy constrained hypothesis (constrained model). This model proposes that increased physical activity decreases other components of metabolism to constrain TEE. There is a logical evolutionary argument for trade-offs in metabolism, but, to date, evidence supporting constraint is subject to several limitations, including cross-sectional and correlational studies with potential methodological issues from extreme differences in body size/composition and lifestyle, potential statistical issues such as regression dilution and spurious correlations, and conclusions drawn from deductive inference rather than direct observation of compensation.</description>

      <title>Effect of Dietary Intervention, with or without Cointerventions, on Inflammatory Markers in Patients with Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
      <link>https://advances.nutrition.org/article/S2161-8313(23)00001-7/fulltext?rss=yes</link>
      <description>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of disease from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, with inflammatory cytokines and adipokines identified as drivers of disease progression. Poor dietary patterns are known to promote an inflammatory milieu, although the effects of specific diets remain largely unknown. This review aimed to gather and summarize new and existing evidence on the effect of dietary intervention on inflammatory markers in patients with NAFLD.</description>
